3. I am independently studying HTML, CSS and JS. My goal is to successfully complete the main course, which will start in September, while completing new tasks for me. Of my strengths, I can single out the fact that I always complete work on time, finish difficult tasks to the end, and in general I am a very motivated person. My dream is to get an internship or get a job related to front-end development.
